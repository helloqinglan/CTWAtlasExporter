#UPDATE: I assumed it would work for SVN and CVS
#but dreamora pointed out that they would have issues
#We use Git and currently have had no issues
#Git is also Rad, I dont use SVN or CVS anymore unless I'm forced.

#this is the git ignore file if you want to use the free Unity 
# the ! negates an ignore, so you ignore everything in Library then
#un-ignore the metadata folder and those specific files
#use at your own risk.

#NOTE: this will cause your collaborators to re-import assets
# (previews and cache), but it seems to have no value to keep in source control

#I also wanted to note that Unity selling an asset server is retarded.
#We already have awesome source control systems that we know are safe and
#reliable. Why anyone would use the asset server is beyond me; why Unity felt the need to
#recreate a well developed tool seems greedy. Focus on your product not on making things 
#more difficult for your users.
